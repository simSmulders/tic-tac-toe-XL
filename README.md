# Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe XL

This repo contains a frontend and backend for a multiplayer tic tac toe game on a 6x6 board. It uses Typescript, Koa, routing-controllers and TypeORM in the backend and React/Redux in the frontend. The backend exposes a REST API but also sends messages over websockets using SocketIO.
